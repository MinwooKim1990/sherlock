## Bootstrap — 2026-05-08

**Phase:** PHASE 0 (sandbox bootstrap)
**Build directory:** `/Users/minwoo_mini/Desktop/claude files/project_sherlock_spec/` (in-place; spec files coexist with build artifacts per OPERATIONS.md § 1.2)

**What I did this session:**

1. Read all 6 spec files in the order the user specified (README → SPEC → AGENTS_AND_LOOP → EVALUATION_PROTOCOL → OPERATIONS → INTENT_DEVIATIONS).
2. Verified environment: `~/Desktop/cli-wrapper-unified/` exists; Python 3.12.13, 3.13, 3.14 available locally; default Gemini model in the wrapper is exactly `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` (matches `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` § 3.3).
3. Created the directory skeleton: `sherlock/`, `tests/{unit,integration,milestones}/`, `prompts/`, `evaluation/runs/`, `logs/`, `state/`.
4. Wrote `.gitignore` (verbatim from `OPERATIONS.md` § 6 plus `.DS_Store`).
5. Wrote `bootstrap.sh` (per `OPERATIONS.md` § 1.3 with the python detection block prioritising `python3.12 → 3.13 → 3.11 → python3` because chromadb / sentence-transformers wheels are not yet guaranteed on 3.14).
6. Wrote skeleton `pyproject.toml` (no runtime deps yet — they grow per milestone).
7. Ran `bash bootstrap.sh` → venv created with **Python 3.12.13**, pip 26.1.1, `sherlock` installed editable. Bootstrap exited 0.
8. Verified the evaluator:
   - `~/Desktop/cli-wrapper-unified/.venv/bin/unified-cli --help` → printed Korean help, exit 0.
   - Smoke chat: `unified-cli chat "Reply with exactly: SHERLOCK_BOOTSTRAP_OK" -m gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --new` → returned `SHERLOCK_BOOTSTRAP_OK` (latency 5195 ms; tokens in/out = 8947/9; session `c713ff26-...`).
   - Python-import path: `pip install -e ~/Desktop/cli-wrapper-unified` → `from unified_cli import create; create('gemini', model='gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview').chat('...')` returns `Response.text` and `Response.session_id`. Smoke call returned `PYIMPORT_OK` (session `9e4686b6-...`).
9. Initialized logs (`logs/raw.jsonl`, `logs/cost.json`, `logs/time.json`) and `state/current.json`.
10. Logged the import-path-vs-CLI choice in `INTENT_DEVIATIONS.md` (DEVIATION-001).

**Verified evaluator invocation shapes:**

CLI form (matches `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` § 3.3 reasonable shape):
```
~/Desktop/cli-wrapper-unified/.venv/bin/unified-cli chat <prompt> \
    -m gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview --new
```
The wrapper does not expose `--system` / `--user-file` / `--output` flags as the spec template suggested. To inject a system prompt, the agent will (a) prepend the rubric inline to the prompt, or (b) use the Python API with `UnifiedConversation` if/when needed. This concrete CLI shape will be re-checked at PHASE 3 evaluation time.

Python form (preferred for evaluation):
```python
from unified_cli import create
r = create("gemini", model="gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview").chat(
    full_prompt_string,  # GOLD + CANDIDATE + rubric inline
)
score_json = r.text  # parse as JSON per evaluator_system_prompt rubric
```

**Open questions (non-blocking):**

- Whether the wrapper supports a true `--system` flag in chat-mode for cleaner system/user separation. Will inspect `src/unified_cli/cli.py` when PHASE 3 evaluation arrives. Current plan: prepend rubric to user message — this still gets scored deterministically because the rubric is in-band.
- API keys for Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini (Sherlock runtime in PHASE 3): the wrapper rides on subscription auth, but Sherlock itself will need real provider keys. Not needed for PHASE 0–2.

**Next:**

Enter PHASE 1 — generate the long synthetic dummy conversation per `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` § 1, self-judge, save to `evaluation/dummy_conversation.md`, write `logs/AWAITING_PHASE1_APPROVAL.md`, stop and wait for `evaluation/PHASE1_APPROVED`.

---

## PHASE 1 — Dummy conversation drafted — 2026-05-08

**Phase:** PHASE 1 (dummy conversation generation)
**Status:** drafted, self-judged top-tier, **awaiting user approval**.

**What I did this session:**

1. Designed a Korean-American freelance UX designer persona (Jiwon, 34, Seoul, daughter Yujin 4yo + soba allergy, freelance for Vancouver-based Nimbus, Tokyo trip June 12-15, Phoebe Bridgers concert anchor, recurring migraines). Persona is bilingual but English-dominant — chose this so Gemini Flash Lite scores deterministically without code-switching variance.
2. Wrote 80 turns. Five interwoven topic threads (Work / Health / Trip / Money / Family) with mid-pivot transitions, "brb" breaks, evening-to-morning continuation, occasional Korean particles ("ㅋㅋ", "근데", "아 진짜"), lowercase casual style.
3. Embedded the patterns required by `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` § 1.1:
   - 11 pinned facts (vs ≥3 spec)
   - 5 decay candidates (vs ≥3 spec): Anthracite Seongsu café, Sora's book "Tomorrow×3", Notion company-structure podcast, Alphablocks, the in-passing emergency-contact aside
   - 8 documented implicit references including a deliberate trap at T76 ("did i ever tell you my last name") — the user never introduces herself in-conversation; the assistant's reply intentionally misremembers ("you introduced yourself yesterday") to test whether Sherlock catches evidence-trail mismatches
   - 7 non-literal intent moments — Wacom-permission-question, neurologist-clothing-bias, "am-i-ready" reassurance-seek
   - 4 corrections (3 user→assistant: in-house→freelance, he→she, React→Vue 3; 1 assistant→user: EpiPen storage)
   - 6 tool affordances with 2 explicit "yes go" / "yes pls" search handoffs (T9-10, T16-17)
   - Time-sensitive content anchored to 2026-05-08: Phoebe Bridgers Tokyo show, iPad Pro M5 pricing, USD/KRW, Vancouver DST end date, Tokyo June weather
4. Wrote `## Notes for evaluators` mapping every pattern to specific turn numbers so the user (and later the gold-standard generation) can cross-reference quickly.
5. Self-judged against the four §1.4 questions and the "researcher embarrassment" test. All four pass; the T76 trap in particular is the kind of probe a real benchmark would publish.
6. Saved to `evaluation/dummy_conversation.md`.
7. Wrote `logs/AWAITING_PHASE1_APPROVAL.md` describing what to look for when reviewing and how to approve / request revision.
8. Updated `state/current.json` to `phase1_awaiting_user`, `blocked_on: evaluation/PHASE1_APPROVED`.

**Self-judgment summary:**

- *Realism:* casual phrasing, real human pacing, occasional assistant errors that the user corrects — passes.
- *Pattern coverage:* every required pattern is present and documented. Counts exceed spec minimums (11 pins vs 3, 5 decay vs 3, etc.).
- *Length sufficient for curation pressure:* 80 turns / ~16-20K tokens. T11→T64, T22→T39→T75, T0→T76 — all distance-references that defeat naive concatenation.
- *Implicit references genuinely implicit:* user never restates context for any of the eight catalogued references.

**Stopping the loop now.** Will not start PHASE 2 until `evaluation/PHASE1_APPROVED` exists.

---

## PHASE 2 — Gold standard drafted + QC pass — 2026-05-08

**Phase:** PHASE 2 (gold standard + cross-cutting QC)
**Status:** drafted, two parallel Explore subagents independently QC'd both artifacts, minor refinements applied, user approved progression to PHASE 3.

**What I did this session:**

1. Wrote `evaluation/gold_standard.md` with all four spec sections (summary / inference / classification / tools). Section 1 is ~27% of conversation token count (slightly above the 10-20% target but justified by complexity per QC). Section 2 has 8 per-turn inferences with honest confidence numbers (0.45-0.85 range, no inflation). Section 3 classifies 17 PIN / 6 ACTIVE / 13 BACKGROUND / 6 DROP items, each with source-turn citations. Section 4 tabulates 8 web-search moments + calculator + current_time + file_read + url_fetch tool calls with explicit "should NOT" subsection.
2. Launched two parallel Explore subagents to QC the dummy and gold standard against `EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md` § 1 and § 2 respectively. Both returned **APPROVE** verdicts with minor cosmetic/pedagogical notes.
3. Applied 5 small refinements:
   - **Dummy T19** — added explicit `[searches: ...]` annotation so the iPad Air trade-in citation is consistent with T10/T17 search-pattern style.
   - **Dummy T25** — replaced "oof" with "아 진짜" to honor the persona-promised Korean particles (subagent flagged the gap).
   - **Dummy T41** — added "근데" particle in Yujin-tantrum aside.
   - **Gold Section 1** — added explicit T67 confabulation flag and a "Facts Sherlock should explicitly let fade" subsection enumerating the over-pin failure modes.
   - **Gold Section 2** — added a confidence-threshold rule paragraph at the top noting inferences below 0.50 must be surfaced as hypotheses, not prior knowledge.
4. User approved continuation to PHASE 3 without formal `PHASE1_APPROVED` / `PHASE2_APPROVED` files (verbal approval through QC review). Treating QC pass + verbal approval as sufficient gate per user preference for minimum-intervention workflow.

**Subagent QC findings (synthesized):**

- Dummy: APPROVE_WITH_NOTES → all 80 turns + 11 patterns verified, T76 trap genuinely undermined when traced through the in-conversation body, decay candidates verified one-mention-only, 3 user corrections genuinely corrective. Cosmetic: Korean particles missing (now fixed), T19 tool affordance weak (now fixed).
- Gold: APPROVE → structure conforms, no hallucinations (every fact traceable to a turn or to a system-source persona note), T76 probe handling is correct, predicted Gemini rubric score 85-90. Pedagogical: T67 confabulation could be more prominent (now fixed), over-pin guidance missing (now added), confidence threshold guidance missing (now added).

**Next:**

Enter **PHASE 3 / M1** — Core skeleton per `SPEC.md` § 9. Expected M1 components: provider abstraction (decision: use litellm — log as DEVIATION-003), pydantic+YAML config loader, bare LLM 1 chat with no memory, sqlmodel SQLite baseline, typer CLI primitives. Exit criterion: `sherlock chat` produces conversation; provider switchable via config without code change.

API keys for runtime providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini) will need to be in env vars when M1 integration tests run. M1 development can proceed with mock-provider fallback when keys are not present.

---

## Loop 1 — M1 build complete — 2026-05-08

**Milestone:** M1 (Core skeleton)
**Status:** all unit + integration tests pass (16 pass / 1 skipped); CLI smoke (`sherlock chat --one-shot`) returns conversation; provider-switch test passes. **Exit criteria met.**

**What I did:**

1. Adopted **litellm** as the M1 provider backend per `SPEC.md` § 11 TBD. Logged as `INTENT_DEVIATIONS.md` DEVIATION-003.
2. Added M1 dependencies: `litellm`, `pydantic`, `pyyaml`, `sqlmodel`, `typer`, `structlog`, `rich`. Plus dev: `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `ruff`, `black`.
3. Built the package surface:
   - `sherlock/config.py` — pydantic models for the M1-relevant subset of `SPEC.md` § 8.3 YAML schema. Validates path existence; resolves relative paths against the YAML file's directory; surfaces `litellm_model_id()` so the same `ModelConfig` works across all six provider families (anthropic / openai / gemini / xai / ollama / lm_studio).
   - `sherlock/providers/base.py` — thin `BaseProvider` ABC + `ChatMessage` / `ChatResponse` dataclasses. The ABC keeps the door open to swap litellm for hand-rolled SDKs later (per DEVIATION-003 reversibility note).
   - `sherlock/providers/litellm_provider.py` — concrete provider wrapping `litellm.completion` / `litellm.acompletion`, including cost extraction and api-base support for Ollama/LM Studio.
   - `sherlock/providers/fake.py` — deterministic in-process provider for hermetic tests. Echoes the last user message; supports a canned reply.
   - `sherlock/storage/db.py` — SQLite via sqlmodel with `Conversation` + `Message` tables; foreign-keys enabled. M2's memory-entry model lands separately.
   - `sherlock/agent.py` — `Sherlock` class with `chat()`, `messages()`, `inspect_last_turn()` per `SPEC.md` § 8.1 M1 surface. Persists every turn to SQLite before the LLM call (crash-safe).
   - `sherlock/cli/main.py` — typer CLI with `chat` (interactive REPL or `--one-shot`), `config validate`, `config show`, `models`. `[project.scripts] sherlock = ...` wires the binary.
   - `prompts/main_system_prompt.md` — generic test prompt for M1.
   - `sherlock.example.yaml` — example config for users to copy.
4. Tests:
   - `tests/unit/test_config.py` — 6 tests covering YAML loading, relative-path resolution, missing-prompt validation, litellm model id routing, env-var key resolution.
   - `tests/unit/test_providers.py` — 4 tests for FakeProvider behavior, build_provider dispatch, async fallback.
   - `tests/unit/test_storage.py` — 2 tests for conversation/message CRUD + persistence.
   - `tests/integration/test_m1_chat.py` — 5 tests: chat persists messages, **provider switch is config-only**, multi-turn history preserved, inspect_last_turn returns state, optional live Anthropic smoke (skipped without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in process env).
5. Test outcome: **16 passed / 1 skipped** in 7s. Live Anthropic smoke is gated on env var being readable from pytest subprocess.
6. CLI end-to-end: `sherlock --help` lists `chat` / `models` / `config`; `sherlock config validate` confirms a YAML; `sherlock chat --one-shot "hello from CLI"` returns the FakeProvider echo; `sherlock models` lists configured models.

**M1 exit criteria (SPEC.md § 9):**
- ✅ `sherlock chat` produces conversation — verified via CLI smoke + integration test.
- ✅ Provider can be switched via config without code change — verified by `test_provider_switch_is_config_only`.

**Open notes for next milestones:**
- Live provider smoke is skipping because `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` isn't propagating to pytest's subprocess in this shell. Code path is wired correctly (litellm reads canonical env vars); should work when run from a shell with `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` properly inherited.
- M2 (memory layer) is the next loop. Will add chromadb + sentence-transformers + LLM-2 summarization cycle + 4-state decay + K-turn original retention.

**Loop 1 result: M1 done. Advancing to M2.**

---

## Loop 2 — M2 → M7 batch + first eval baseline — 2026-05-08

**Milestones touched:** M2 (memory), M3 (bootstrap + LLM-3 + web search), M4-light (BM25 hybrid), M5 (async wrap), M6-light (versioning), M7 (tool layer). Plus the evaluation harness that enables the Ralph verification loop.

**What I did:**

1. **Built M2 memory layer:** `sherlock/memory/{entry,embeddings,store,decay,summarizer,k_turn}.py`. MemoryEntry per SPEC §6.1, Chroma-backed vector store + LiteLLM embedding wrapper + FakeEmbeddingProvider, 4-state decay engine with both day-based and turn-based thresholds, LLM-2 summarizer with n-turn + topic-change triggers, K-turn original-retention policy.
2. **Built M3 bootstrap + inference + tools:** `sherlock/bootstrap/{engine,meta_context}.py` (LLM-1 authors LLM-2/LLM-3 prompts; meta-context document includes condensed Appendix A); `sherlock/inference/engine.py` (LLM-3 producing ≥3 hypotheses, persisted with confidence + evidence); `sherlock/tools/{builtin,web_search}.py` (current_time, calculator, url_fetch, file_read + Tavily/StubSearch).
3. **M4-light:** `sherlock/rag/hybrid.py` with vector + BM25 + Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60). Wired into agent.
4. **M5 async:** `Sherlock.achat()` runs LLM-3 + retrieval in parallel; summarizer + decay also parallel after response.
5. **M6-light:** `sherlock/evolution/versioning.py` for CompanionPrompt revisions.
6. **Evaluation harness:** `sherlock/evaluation/{replay,output_format,evaluator}.py` + `evaluation/evaluator_system_prompt.txt`. CLI `sherlock evaluate` writes `evaluation/runs/<ISO>/{sherlock_output.md,evaluator_output.json,score.txt,comparison_input.md}`.
7. **WrapperProvider (DEVIATION-004):** because `os.environ.get('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')` returns None in this Python process despite the user's shell having it set, I added `sherlock/providers/wrapper_provider.py` to ride on `cli-wrapper-unified` subscription auth. The wrapper is the user's existing tool. Logged as DEVIATION-004 in `INTENT_DEVIATIONS.md` with reversal instructions.
8. **Iterated on companion prompts** before this loop's eval started: tightened `DEFAULT_LLM3_PROMPT` to push provenance probes (T76 trap) and the implicit-ask catalog harder; tightened `DEFAULT_LLM2_PROMPT` and `META_CONTEXT` to be explicit about pinning vs let-fade discipline.

**First eval attempt (loop-2 baseline, killed):**
- Initial config used `wrapper-claude / claude-haiku-4-5` for all three roles.
- Bootstrap-authored companion prompts came out **excellent** (saw them in flight): worked example with code-mixing, explicit clue categories, provenance discipline, semantic triple guidance.
- Per-turn rate measured at ~60s/turn → 80 turns = 80 minutes. Killed at turn 7.

**Reconfigured for loop 2 baseline:**
- Switched LLM-2 + LLM-3 to `wrapper-gemini / gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` (3-4s/call vs Claude haiku's 10-15s via wrapper). LLM-1 stays on claude-haiku-4-5 (the user-facing answer quality matters most).
- Capped first run at 30 turns to get a baseline fast.
- Improved progress callback: prints every 5 turns with elapsed time + rate + ETA.

**Now running:** 30-turn eval with the new mixed-provider config. Will land a real score and trigger the diagnose-fix-retry Ralph cycle from there.

---

## Loop 2 — Baseline landed: 57/100 — 2026-05-08

**Run:** `evaluation/runs/2026-05-08T05-06-40/` (30 turns of the dummy, ~13 min wall-clock).

**Score breakdown:**
| Dimension | Score | Why |
|---|---|---|
| summary_fidelity | 65 | Decent prose but missed the Vue-3-not-React correction (T27 was outside the 30-turn cap) and a few specifics. |
| inference_quality | 60 | Hypotheses with confidence + evidence emerged, but provenance tracking + hidden-structure analysis were thin. |
| **classification_correctness** | **30** | **Lowest dimension.** "Repetitive, bloated list of facts (many redundant) rather than a structured taxonomy of PIN/ACTIVE/BACKGROUND/DROP." The over-pinning failure mode (LLM-2 re-emitting paraphrases on every cycle, no add-time dedup) blew up. PIN had 70+ entries; gold has 17. |
| tool_recommendations | 50 | The old formatter's Section 4 only printed hypothesis-counts-by-reasoning-type, not a per-turn tool table. |

**Mid-run incident:** Claude CLI (via wrapper) executed a `Write` tool during turn ~22 and dropped `tokyo_trip_reference.md` into the project root as a side-effect. Removed and added a TEXT-ONLY guard banner to every flattened wrapper prompt to prevent recurrence.

**Diagnosis → Loop 3 plan (all already committed):**
1. Classification fix: **dedup-at-add** in MemoryStore (when a near-duplicate exists, touch + upgrade pinned/confidence in-place rather than spawn a new row). Should cut PIN bucket from 70+ to ~15-20.
2. Tool fix: **Section 4** now renders a per-turn-tools table from `agent._tool_call_history` with freshness + context-expand subsections.
3. Inference fix: tightened **DEFAULT_LLM3_PROMPT** + **META_CONTEXT** to mandate provenance discipline (T76 trap) and an implicit-ask catalog. **Section 2 finalisation prompt** now mandates user-stated vs system-inferred distinction, named-thread coupling analysis, ≥2-3 candidate hypotheses per highlight with quoted evidence.
4. Summary fix: **Section 1 finalisation prompt** now ingests pinned-facts and chronological user-utterances alongside per-segment summaries (was: only segment summaries). Also demands all pinned facts appear, names the 5 threads, surfaces user corrections explicitly.

**Loop 3 running now:** same 30-turn cap so the comparison is apples-to-apples.

---

## Loop 3 — REGRESSED to 48/100 — 2026-05-08

**Run:** `evaluation/runs/2026-05-08T05-21-57/` (30 turns).

**Score breakdown vs loop-2:**
| Dimension | Loop-2 | Loop-3 | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| summary_fidelity | 65 | 65 | 0 |
| inference_quality | 60 | **45** | **−15** |
| classification_correctness | 30 | 30 | 0 |
| tool_recommendations | 50 | **20** | **−30** |
| **final** | **57** | **48** | **−9** |

**Why I made it worse — the evaluator named all three failures specifically:**

1. *"Lacks the critical distinction between system-inferred and user-stated provenance (classifying system-level identity as user-stated)"* — my dedup-at-add added a source-rank UPGRADE rule. When LLM-2 paraphrased a domain-hint persona fact and re-emitted it with `source="user"`, my dedup found the existing SYSTEM-source entry and **promoted** it to USER. So persona facts started looking user-stated. Direct cause of the inference dimension drop.

2. *"Recommending searches for nearly every turn, including those explicitly marked against in the Gold Standard"* — Section 4 finally rendered actual tool recommendations from `_tool_call_history`, but LLM-3 was over-recommending tools because the prompt didn't have a discipline clause. Direct cause of the tool dimension drop.

3. *"Listing trivial domain color and redundant facts as PIN"* — I forgot user_utterance entries were going into the PIN/ACTIVE/BACKGROUND/DROP buckets at all. They're transcript replay, not curated memory. Plus the SYSTEM-source pinned domain hints were indistinguishable from real user-stated PINs in the output.

**Loop 4 fixes (committed):**
1. **SYSTEM source is sticky** in `MemoryStore.add()` dedup — once SYSTEM, never upgraded. Direct fix for failure #1.
2. **Tool-rec discipline** added to `DEFAULT_LLM3_PROMPT`: "tools_recommended should be EMPTY for most turns. An average conversation has 3-8 turns where tools meaningfully help." Direct fix for failure #2.
3. **Section 3 formatter** now (a) excludes USER_UTTERANCE entries from the buckets entirely, and (b) splits PIN into `PIN — user-stated` vs `PIN (system-source) — persona/domain hints, NOT user-stated`. Direct fix for failure #3, plus makes the provenance distinction visible to the evaluator.

**Loop 4 running now** with the same 30-turn cap.

---

## Loop 4 — partial recovery to 50/100 (still below baseline) — 2026-05-08

**Run:** `evaluation/runs/2026-05-08T05-36-59/`. 30 turns, ~13 min.

**Score breakdown vs prior:**
| Dimension | L2 | L3 | L4 | trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| summary_fidelity | 65 | 65 | 65 | flat |
| inference_quality | 60 | 45 | 45 | flat (still below baseline) |
| classification_correctness | 30 | 30 | 30 | flat (still bad) |
| tool_recommendations | 50 | 20 | 40 | partial recover |
| **final** | **57** | **48** | **50** | partial recover |

**Evaluator's notes (verbatim) — three named failures:**
1. *"Massive lists of repetitive, low-value 'facts' and 'inferences' that are redundant or hallucinated"* → dedup-at-add catches exact / 60-prefix matches but NOT semantic paraphrases. LLM-2 emits "Yujin has soba allergy" / "User's child Yujin is allergic to soba" / "User has 4yo daughter Yujin with buckwheat allergy" → all distinct under prefix dedup, all collapse into the same fact semantically.
2. *"Classification section is flooded with thousands of words of noise"* → Section 3 was rendering everything; max_items=60 per bucket was too lax.
3. *"Completely misses the deliberate traps (confabulations) identified in the gold standard (e.g., the name trap at T76)"* → **30-turn cap structurally prevents T76 from being reached.** The cap was for fast iteration but it cut off all the high-information moments.

**Loop 5 fixes (committed):**
1. **summarizer.run() now passes the current PIN list to LLM-2** as an "ALREADY-KNOWN FACTS — do NOT re-emit" block. The model can now see the persisted state and SHOULD stop paraphrasing the same fact 5 times. Direct fix for failure #1.
2. **Section 3 `max_items` per bucket dropped from 60 to 25.** Combined with the per-conversation `cap_pinned(max=25)` from loop-5-prep, the classification section is now bounded. Direct fix for failure #2.
3. **Loop 5 runs the FULL 80 turns**. T76 (name probe), T55 (EpiPen catch), T67 (prior-fintech role), all the corrections at T20 / T27 — every one is reachable. Direct fix for failure #3.

**Loop 5 expected runtime:** ~30-35 min. Bigger but the only way to actually exercise the gold standard's hardest probes.

---

## Loop 5 — full 80 turns: 48/100, same as loop 3 — 2026-05-08

**Run:** `evaluation/runs/2026-05-08T05-52-01/`. 80 turns, ~37 min replay + format + eval.

**Score:** 48 (= loop-3 = below baseline by 9).

**The decisive diagnostic:** the evaluator names the tool-rec failure precisely — *"flagged 54/80 turns when the gold standard identifies only ~10-12 legitimate external lookups"*. Yet I had committed a tool-discipline rule into `DEFAULT_LLM3_PROMPT` before loop 4. Why didn't it stick?

**Root cause finally identified:** when `bootstrap.auto_run_on_init: true` (default in `sherlock.live.yaml`), the **Bootstrap engine calls LLM-1 to author fresh LLM-2 and LLM-3 system prompts at every run**, completely overriding `DEFAULT_*_PROMPT`. So my edits to `DEFAULT_LLM3_PROMPT` from loops 4 and 5 had zero effect on tool-recommendation behavior — the bootstrap-authored prompts simply didn't carry the rule.

This explains the flat trajectory at 48-57 across loops 3-5 despite multiple targeted fixes: the targeted fixes weren't reaching the prompts in flight.

**Loop 6 fix:** the new tool-discipline + let_fade-discipline + (already present) provenance rules now live in `META_CONTEXT`. `META_CONTEXT` is the document LLM-1 reads while *authoring* the companion prompts — it carries discipline forward into whatever LLM-1 produces. The new META_CONTEXT explicitly tells LLM-1 that "the authored LLM-3 prompt MUST embed the verbatim tool-discipline rules" and "the authored LLM-2 prompt MUST teach the let_fade pattern". This is the right level for the rule to live.

**Other loop-6 prep already committed:**
- Semantic dedup at write time (cosine ≥ 0.92) on top of prefix-60 dedup. Catches "Yujin has soba allergy" / "User's child Yujin is allergic to soba" / "User has 4yo daughter Yujin with buckwheat allergy" as one fact.
- `let_fade=true` from LLM-2 now lands the entry directly in COLD state (skips FRESH/WARM) and never pins it. The 5 documented decay candidates should now flow into BACKGROUND/DROP.
- Section 1 length target: 500-900 words. Section 2 target: 700-1200 words. Loop-4 evaluator complained about "thousands of words of noise"; the targets push back.
- LLM-2 PIN context shown to it capped at 25 most-recent items instead of 60 (smaller prompt, less paraphrase pressure).

**Loop 6 running now** with all of the above active. Expected runtime ~30-35 min.
